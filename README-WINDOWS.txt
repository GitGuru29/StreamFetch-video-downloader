HOW TO GET THE .EXE FILE
========================

Because I am running on Linux, I cannot generate a Windows executable (.exe) directly.

Steps to get StreamFetch.exe:

1. Transfer the file "StreamFetch-Source.tar.gz" to your Windows computer.
2. Extract the archive (you can use 7-Zip, WinRAR, or Windows native tar support).
3. Open a command prompt inside the extracted folder.
4. Run the build script:
   
   build_windows.bat

5. The executable will be created in the "dist" folder inside that directory.

Enjoy!
